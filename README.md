# SimpleDB-Rust

A Rust port of SimpleDB from Edward Sciore's "Database Design and Implementation" book.

## Project Overview

This project aims to reimplement SimpleDB, originally written in Java, using the Rust programming language. SimpleDB is an educational database system designed to teach the fundamental concepts of relational databases, including:

- File and record management
- Buffer management
- Transactions and recovery
- Query processing and optimization
- SQL parsing and execution

## Goals

- Explore effective patterns for Java to Rust translation
- Implement a safe database system leveraging Rust's ownership and type system
- Improve performance and memory efficiency
- Provide an educational database system
